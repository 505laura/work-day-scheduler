## Description
This webpage is designed to work as a schedule and/or calendar for a standard (9am-5pm) workday. It provides users with the ability to enter their events or tasks in separate time blocks according to the time of day and save them so that they will remain in the schedule even once you leave or refresh the page. 
The color of each timeblock will change according to the time of day the page is accessed:
* For hours that have passed, the timeblock will be colored grey.
* For the current hour, the timeblock will be colored red.
* For upcoming hours, the timeblock will be colored green.
